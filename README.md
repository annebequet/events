# Project

This application retrieves from different sources informations about events (dates, location, type...) and provides the user with the possibility to subscribe to them.

# Main features

- Calendar that displays events
- Possibility to subscribe/unsuscribe to locations to get a list of their event on the app calendar.
- Possibility to subscribe/unsuscribe to locations to get a list of their event on my own calendar (Google calendar...).
- User account to register those infos.
